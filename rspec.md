## It's Ruby code!

The golden rule: RSpec code is Ruby. Any [Ruby styleguide](https://github.com/HouseTrip/ruby-style-guide) rule applies.

Examples:
- Don't write multiline `let`s and `subject`s with `{ }`, use `do end` instead.

## Code organization

- In a context, define `before` blocks, then `let` blocks, then leave a blank line and start defining assertions.
- If you have a subject for the context place it between pre-definitions and assertions, again with a blank line
- Keep any code that's not assertions outside `it` blocks. Use `let` and `before` blocks for that.

```ruby
describe Review do
  context 'with a photo' do
    before { initialize_stuff }
    let(:photo) { Photo.new }

    subject { Review.new }

    it { should be_blank }
    its(:rating) { should be_nil }
  end
end
```

## Syntax

Make heavy use of RSpec helpers.

- For all predicates you can use the `be_` syntax

```ruby
# bad
it { subject.published? eql(true) }

# good
it { subject be_published }
```
*Rspec 1.3 only*: For methods which return a boolean, e.g. `active?`, use `eq false` not `be_false`, since `be_false` will allowed `nil` as well as `false` and is the same as `be_falsey` in rspec 3.

- When testing size of an array or array-like object (e.g.: an ActiveRecord relation) use the `have` matcher. RSpec will send the trailing method and `size` to the object for you

```ruby
# bad
it { subject.reviews.size.should eql(3) }

# good
it { should have(3).reviews }
```

### `specify` versus `it`

`specify` and `it` are aliases, you should prefer `it` as it reads better.

## Single expectations

The 'one expectation' tip is more broadly expressed as 'each test should make only one assertion'. This helps you on finding possible errors, going directly to the failing test, and to make your code readable.

In isolated unit specs, you want each example to specify one (and only one) behavior. Multiple expectations in the same example are a signal that you may be specifying multiple behaviors.

```ruby
# bad
it 'checks a new review'
  review = Review.new(:rating => 9)

  review.rating.should eql(9)
  review.should be_valid
end

# good
context 'with a new review'
  subject { Review.new(:rating => 9) }

  it { should be_valid }
  its(:rating) { should eql(9) }
end
```

### Namespaced classes/modules

Specs for namespaced classes/modules should have their specs namespaced, its
less verbose and reads better.

```ruby
# bad
describe Foo::Bar do
end

# good
module Foo
  describe Bar do
  end
end
```

## Describing objects

```ruby
# bad
describe 'the authenticate method for User' do
describe 'if the user is an admin' do

# good
describe '.authenticate' do
describe '#admin?' do
```

## Using contexts

```ruby
# bad
it 'has 200 status code if logged in' do
  expect(response).to respond_with 200
end

it 'has 401 status code if not logged in' do
  expect(response).to respond_with 401
end

# good
context 'when logged in' do
  it { should respond_with 200 }
end

context 'when logged out' do
  it { should respond_with 401 }
end
```

## subject

- If you have several tests related to the same subject use subject{} to DRY them up.
- Make use of `its` to send messages to the `subject` and check its characteristics

```ruby
# bad
it { expect(assigns('message')).to match /it was born in Belville/ }
it { expect(assigns('message').creator).to match /Topolino/ }

# good
subject { assigns('message') }
it { should match /it was born in Billville/ }
its(:creator) { should match /Topolino/ }
```

## let

When you have to assign a variable instead of using a before block to create an instance variable, use let. Using let the variable lazy loads only when it is used the first time in the test and get cached until that specific test is finished.

```ruby
# bad
describe '#type_id' do
  before { @resource = FactoryGirl.create :device }
  before { @type     = Type.find @resource.type_id }

  it 'sets the type_id field' do
    expect(@resource.type_id).to == @type.id
  end
end

# good
describe '#type_id' do
  let(:resource) { FactoryGirl.create :device }
  let(:type)     { Type.find resource.type_id }

  it 'sets the type_id field' do
    resource.type_id.should eql(type.id)
  end
end
```

If you need something initialized immediately (e.g.: database records are involved) use `let!`, so that your object gets evaluated like it was in a `before` block.


## Mocks and stubs

- Never mock or stub stuff of the class you're testing
- Stub external dependencies

## Testing modules

Instead of creating a class in which to include the module under test, which is
global and will populate subsequent tests, create an anonymous class.

```ruby
# bad
class MySpecClass < SomeOtherClass
  include SomeModule
end

describe SomeModule do
  subject { MySpecClass.new }
  # ...
end

# good
describe SomeModule do
  subject { Class.new(SomeOtherClass) { include SomeModule } }
  # ...
end
```

## Acceptance tests

Acceptance tests in Rspec live in the `spec/features` folder and need to be tagged with `feature: true` in order to be run with javascript support (PhantomJS via Poltergeist). Interaction with the page content should only be done through page objects which are stored in `spec/support/pages`. This enforces better encapsulation and enables reuse.

### Page objects

http://dev.housetrip.com/2014/05/22/page-objects/

```ruby
class MyComponent
  # Returns true if elements exists _and_ is not visible
  def hidden?
    @page.has_selector?(selector, visible: false)
  end

  # Returns true if element exists _and_ is visible. This is Capybara default behaviour.
  def visible?
    @page.has_selector?(selector, visible: true)
  end
end
```

It was decided not to override `present?` and `blank?`.

## Shared examples

Do NOT use them. They make things DRY but the cost is too high. If it fails it makes things much more difficult to debug, and the error messages can be confusing.
Also when used across files, it is less readable and making them reusable can become a challenge very fast.

## Custom matchers

TBD

## Test interface, not implementation

Test object inner workings and application behaviour (integration tests). If you are about to test a controller, stop and move away logic from it.

TBD

## Stub HTTP requests

TBD

## Other stuff
